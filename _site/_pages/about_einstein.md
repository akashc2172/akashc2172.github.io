As rumors of COVID vaccine distribution spread across California, I was curious about how the
California Department of Public Health (CDPH) would approach the logistics of vaccine
verification. The reporting system needed to be so intuitive that everyone could grasp it, while
being efficient enough to avoid a decathlon of verification steps every single time it was used.
Most importantly, the verification system needed to be fortified against fraud to ensure public
safety and trust.

With this set of prerequisites, there were so many routes that the CDPH could take. Maybe they
could take a page out of the crypto world's book and try something with blockchain to create a
decentralized, tamper-proof system. Or maybe they'd choose a traditional path and empower healthcare providers to manage vaccination records through their preferred Electronic Health Record. Or maybe (and this was the most captivating possibility), we'd see unprecedented innovation: a new era of healthcare recording systems born out of necessity.

You can imagine my disappointment fresh off my first COVID vaccine shot, watching a nurse handwrite my details on a paper card. In an age where my phone unlocks with my face and I can have groceries delivered with a few taps on a screen, this rudimentary piece of paper could be taken down by an anti-vaxxer with a copy machine. It was this jarring disconnect between the technological marvels I use daily and the antiquated systems in healthcare that begged the question: why does healthcare lag so far behind?

These personal incidents are far from isolated cases; they point to deep-seated systemic issues that slow innovation and create unnecessary roadblocks within the healthcare system. Take my dad's experience trying to navigate an insurance portal when changing jobs. We spent HOURS on hold, trying to decipher forms meant for an accountant, not an average person. He's tech-savvy; it wasn't his fault. Turns out, even in 2024, a critical part of health coverage might as well be in hieroglyphics. That stuck with me - if something this common requires this much guesswork, imagine the invisible friction hidden in more complex aspects of medicine. 

The deeper I explored, the more apparent the discrepancies became. Why do we tolerate the high costs and production time of traditional prosthetics when 3D-printing technology offers affordability and customization? Why is the emergency room still the first port of call for situations perfectly suited to telehealth's capabilities for preliminary diagnostics? So when my PI lamented the difficulties for urologists to visualize anatomy through 2D images and videos during pre-operative planning, it was just another thought: why aren't phones being used in the operating room to create interactable 3D scans when Apple has supported Augmented Reality since 2017? This time, however, I had the chance to do more than just question the system - I could test if readily available tools could make a real difference. Turns out, after a summer working alongside MirrorMe3D, the simple mobile photogrammetry techniques I found tucked away in a 2018 GitHub repository proved effective in a clinical setting. "Vintage" tech for the win. 

Healthcare shouldn't feel like a scavenger hunt where only the most persistent (and those with flexible work schedules and endless patience!) discover the solutions they need. My drive stems from that frustration, and a conviction that most problems in this sector have roots in archaic systems, not a lack of brilliant people or potential tools. The tech behind self-driving cars and instant language translation exists - so do the minds capable of bridging those gaps to simplify and humanize healthcare. I want to be part of that evolution, making healthcare delivery just as efficient and adaptable as the remarkable world outside the clinic walls.
