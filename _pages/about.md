I'm a 2nd year Computational and Systems Biology student at UCLA. I'm born and raised in the Los Angeles area, and my obssession with LA-area sports analytics motivated me to get into coding.

Now an undergraduate, I'm interested in Medtech research, and would like to pursue a PhD in bioengineering following graduation. For now, I do  bioengineering research for the DGSOM Urology department at [Fielding School of Public Health](https://ph.ucla.edu/). I'm also passionate about making education more accessible for disadvantaged K-12 students - check out my CV page for more!
